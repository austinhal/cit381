"The movie is more entertaining than it is haunting, and with Shyamalan, I'm greedy enough to want both, like in his best movies",Michael Smith
"February 13, 2019",Federico Furzan
Jackson's unfailing screen presence is just the kick in the pants Shyamalan's uneven screenplay requires to come to life.,J. Olson
"What could have been a stellar ending to this trilogy, was only just a fine one. I also really wanted more of Bruce Willis.",Lauren Veneziani
"The Sixth Sense, The Visit and Split showed that Shyamalan has real talent as a director of suspense, and there are sparks of that here, yet the film strains for your attention and stumbles with a very awkward ending.",Jim Schembri
"With a movie jumping from character to character so often, it just didn't have flow or pacing or tone.",Perri Nemiroff
"The filmmaking is a little pedestrian, and one scene - in which Ana puts on a cheery face as she dances for her delighted former pupils - goes on far too long, but this is a compelling and not very well known story...",Anton Bitel
a largely entertaining action thriller that doesn't go exactly where you expect it go and indulges in quite a bit of meta-commentary on the nature of comic book narratives.,James Kendrick
"Shyamalan is going to do what he always does, erecting the scaffolding of the story around one tenuous idea until it comes crashing down because of the...THE TWIST.",Eli Glasner
"Con Anya Taylor-Joy, uno de los puntos más fuertes de Fragmentado, relegada a un rol casi figurante, Glass pierde la oportunidad de ahondar en el conflicto de su antecesora a cambio de un ""choque superhéroe"" intranscendente.",Julio Fernando Navas
"19 years in the making, James McCoy is the real star of GLASS, which has a captivating first act, but then it slips into a cliche of its genre, only to pick up steam within the last 45 minutes",Carla Renata
"It'd be nice to report that Glass is over-flowing with promise, or that Shyamalan has once again found his groove, but the truth is that Glass is...bone-dry.",Tom Santilli
"The central concepts in ""Glass"" are laughable, with a script that regularly descends into self-parody to such an extent that it's hard to envision an actual parody to this movie.",Andrea Thompson
"What's disappointing isn't that Shyamalan chose not to make Unbreakable 2; it's that what began so successfully with Unbreakable has devolved into such thoroughly unsatisfying pulp, void of any real humanity.",Adam Kempenaar
"I liked the twist ending...it was definitely not like The Village, which had a forced twist ending.",Tony Baker
"The obvious limitations of the film's budget for expensive visual effects made the movie focus more on the analytical dissection of what we've come to expect and love about super hero stories. The twist is, it worked.",Alachia Queen
"A disastrous, unearned and disappointing ending derails what at first felt as a decent, satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy. [Full review in Spanish]",Fico Cangiano
A full-fledged requiem that Syamalan executes as if it were his testament. [Full Review in Spanish],Fausto Fernandez
Bruce Willis is sleepwalking through this movie.,Martin Thomas
We know that we're watching a comic book movie... [it] suffers from just being too self aware.,Korey Coleman
Perhaps the biggest tragedy of Glass is how short it falls of its own potential.,Cian Geoghegan
"January 29, 2019",Rosie Knight
I went with it... I thought this was Shyamalan's best film since Signs.,Mark Kermode
"Glass has no shortage of ideas to dissect and debate. If we have to give up some of the flash and action to have them, that's a trade I, for one, am more than ready to make.",Megan Basham
"[E]ventually, Shyamalan will have to confront his delusion that he's so much smarter than his audience. It's been a while since he convinced anyone.",Roe McDermott
The conclusion to M. Night Shyamalan's unexpected superhero trilogy feels like a wasted opportunity.,Tom Glasson
A key problem is that we don't learn anything new about its central trio...nor are they given anything to do that we haven't seen them do in their previous films.,Michael Gingold
"""There is a very thin line between conviction and parody, and I have the feeling that Shyamalan crosses that line several times in different directions"".",Ernesto Diezmartinez
"It has plot holes you could fly a space shuttle through, inexplicable decisions about story and twists that don't hold up to even the faintest scrutiny.",TK Burton
'Glass' is worth a look but not the best of Shyamalan.,Linda Cook
And the streak of non-lousy Shyamalan films stops at two.,Bob Grimm
"...has a refreshing, lo-fi superhero sensibility.",Josh Larsen
Attempts to marry the realist take on the superhero mythos from the first film with the schlock sensibility of the second. This is like putting a cat's head on a raven's body. The creature doesn't live long but while it does it's fascinating to watch.,Ed Whitfield
Glass is the kind of movie that continues to pretend comics are still an outsider pursuit and demand to be taken so very seriously. Someone should tell Kevin Feige.,Kyle Pinion
"talky and inert, Glass sticks to a single, boring location for the majority of its running time. Then there's a twist, and not a very good one.",Stephen Silver
"This is a gripping, intelligent psychological thriller that is lifted beyond ""normal"" by McAvoy and all the people inside him.",Stephen Romei
"Glass represents an authorial vision in a ubiquitous genre where the author is rarely present. And that, in itself, should already be a reason to celebrate this. [Full review in Spanish]",Daniel Krauze
"There are a few thoughtfully placed cameras and thrilling moments - Bruce Willis vs. a door, for one - but they're not nearly enough to make this self-conscious live-action comic book worthwhile.",Matthew Lickona
I admire Shyamalan's ambitions but Glass feels like several movies crammed and compressed into one and it almost always highlights the wrong movie at the wrong time.,Brian Gill
"Frustrating and mediocre, and not the Unbreakable sequel many fans have waited 18 years for. McAvoy impresses once again, however the lack of narrative rigour makes it hard to care.",Linda Marric
"Despite being a critique of superhero tropes at a time when those tropes have never been more ubiquitous, Glass never quite gels in a way that lives up to the promise of its premise",Zaki Hasan
"January 24, 2019",Alex Leininger
"A frustrating, intriguing failure.",Charles Koplinski
"Contrived and absurdly fragmented, it emerges as far too ambiguous to be satisfying.",Susan Granger
"What came through was a piece of film that undermined the innovations in storytelling offered by the genre. I left the theatre feeling cheated, just like when I saw Batman v. Superman.",Frantz Jerome
Glass may be flawed but it's still a thoughtful tonic to today's all-action superhero sagas.,Jeremy Aspinall
"Is Shyamalan mocking us film buffs with Kevin Wendell Crumb's personalities, one a film professor and one given to movie spoilers? I hope so. By no means a disaster (McAvoy is exceptional, for a start) it meanders, and is curiously unengaging.",Sarah Cartland
"Beyond giving James McAvoy more chances to show off, the script is a bloated, wandering mess.",Tim Brayton
(...) [E]verything that made Unbreakable one of the better ruminations on superhero archetypes on film is missing from Glass.,Emily Asher-Perrin
"Here, even when his plot points shatter under cursory examination, [Shyamalan's] love of storytelling is transparent.",Margot Harrison
"Glass, is a movie that has good ideas. It knows how to show them, but not how to talk about them. If it were a silent movie, it would win an Oscar.",Damian Levy
"The ending isn't really earned by the characters or the script but the idea of a reverse origin story was mildly interesting. It wasn't great but I didn't hate it, so there you go! McAvoy steals the show once again",Rachel Wagner
"Glass is the proof we really should be careful what we wish for - something I stupidly ignored when I wrote about Unbreakable, 19 years ago, and wished for a sequel.",Pablo Villaça
"Glass may have been a film nineteen years in the making, but it feels superfluous and incredibly out of touch in a world littered with superhero films.",Jake Tropila
"This film clearly represents what Shyamalan wants to say, but even viewers who agree with him in general may not feel this is the best way to frame the message.",Abbie Bernstein
"I wish Glass were either much better or much worse than it is. It is neither a satisfying conclusion to a trilogy, nor an entertainingly bad disaster. It's just kind of dull.",Jennifer Heaton
"Earnest and humorless, this is a faux-intellectual Comic Book Guy ponderously well-actually-ing us about shallow superhero tropes and clichés as if those are the most intriguing bits of these stories.",MaryAnn Johanson
"We may be facing one of the most misunderstood titles of the year, a masterful work, beautiful even with its imperfections, which floods [its] authentic love for comics in each frame. [Full review in Spanish]",José Martín
It is bold. [Full Review in Spanish],Alejandro G. Calvo
"It's fair enough to complain that superhero films are usually overstuffed with CGI, but try watching one with hardly any special effects and a preference for humourless talking points.",Edward Porter
"Unfortunately the story, which sees Sarah Paulson playing a hospital psychiatrist who specialises in treating 'those individuals who believe they are superheroes', isn't a great one.",Matthew Bond
"January 22, 2019",Alci Rengifo
Far more of a mediocre Split sequel than a continuation of Unbreakable/new exploration of Glass.,Richard Bardon
"In Glass, Shyamalan ups the exploitative ante -- adding social collapse to serial-killer-threat and girl-victim dread.",Armond White
"Glass is the comic book movie that tells an interesting story, but fails to give you the slam dunk ending it leads you to believe it'll deliver.",Emmanuel Noisette
"The end result is a confused film where, unlike previous instalments, there's no emotional connection to the central characters, and the biggest shock is how slow the clock is ticking.",Harry Guerin
"Glass is extraordinarily transparent in its politics and, in that, honours comic books most of all.",Walter Chaw
"I love me a good M. Night Shyamalan film. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.",Kent Garrison
"The result may only be satisfying for true believers, but in a pop culture awash in tights and capes, maybe it's OK for a little navel-gazing into our collective obsession with superheroes.",Mathew DeKinder
Forget about trying to ascertain whether Glass should be viewed as half-full or half-empty. This is such a parched project that viewers will leave with the irritable sensation that there's sand trapped in their shorts ... or possibly in their heads.,Matt Brunson
This Glass is half empty.,Sarah Marrs
What the film lacks in sanity and formal brilliance...it makes up for in charisma and enthusiasm.,Nathanael Hood
"I obviously feel mixed on GLASS. It is, in many ways, an almost perfect representation of Shymalan's strengths and weaknesses as a filmmaker; his tools and excesses. What makes him great was all on-screen, right along what makes him so frustrating.",Tim Stevens
"Hollywood and its superhero franchises are all but coextensive, and Shyamalan's confrontation with the ubiquity, popularity, and dominance of superheroes gives ""Glass"" a second-level urgency.",Richard Brody
"It was not an epic closing, but this film did not require it, it was enough to be enough and loyal to his style, something that undoubtedly achieves. [Full Review in Spanish]",Rafael Rosales Santos
"Glass finally cracks due to Shyamalan's declining powers of plot and dialogue, falling far short of Mr Glass's deviousness.",Nick Hasted
"[A] genre deconstruction that is somehow smarter than it's given credit for while also not being as smart as it believes itself to be...an uneven, yet ultimately satisfying ending.",Allen Adams
"Glass doesn't end at the climax. It rolls over, goes to sleep and snores for 30 minutes before the credits roll.",Tim Martain
"Glass is almost an anti-blockbuster, and I admire its commitment to not caring what you think of it...I apologize for being so unhelpful, but I genuinely don't know if Glass is a good film or not.",Tim Brennan
Shyamalan is incredibly gifted. He's also suffering from delusions of grandeur.,Charlotte O'Sullivan
"The metaphors are messy (trauma makes people extraordinary?) and the pacing's off, but it's fun to see the individual films' universes crossing over.",Simran Hans
"January 20, 2019",Shaun Munro
You've got to hand it to M.Night Shyamalan for sheer chutzpah but ultimately the grand scale concept dissipates in a puff of its own self-importance.,Louise Keller
"A uniquely structured film for the genre, Shyamalan's Glass deconstructs society's infatuation with superheroes and delivers with a thrilling conclusion to a trilogy that began 19 years ago.",Sheraz Farooqi
"A nerdy deep-dive into the filmmaker's ideas about superhero movies... Nutty, self-aware, periodically thrilling.",Eric D. Snider
Ce n'est pas parfait. Ce n'est certainement pas pour tout le monde. Mais c'est une proposition aussi foisonnante que fascinante dont je ne peux que saluer l'originalité et l'audace. [Full review in French],Kevin N. Laforest
M.Night Shyamalan's films are often incredibly divisive and it's likely that Glass will be his most divisive yet. The converging of Unbreakable and Split sees Shyamalan working to all his strengths as a filmmaker - and his weaknesses.,Niall Browne
Shyamalan's final entry in his unlikely cinematic universe is a Split sequel with Unbreakable filling; but what's the point if none of it makes sense?,Cameron Frew
None of this is a happy accident; it's a confident creator's act of will and a worthy conclusion... the unironically self-aware meta comic book film... those who want to believe will be well rewarded.,Kevin A. Ranson
"While not as strong as its predecessors, even shattered glass has interesting pieces.",Courtney Small
"If GIass shows us anything, it's that Shyamalan learned almost nothing following his fall from/return to critical and box office grace.",Pete Vonder Haar
"Shyamalan shoots Glass as dully as possible. The budget on the film was only $20 million. Frankly, the movie looks cheaper.",Alan French
A wasted opportunity of a movie that tries to shamelessly pander to a fan base it clearly doesn't actually understand. Flashes of excellence that never materializes into anything more than fleeting moments.,John Campea
Unfortunately the possibility of a great film is overpowered by the filmmaker's excessive self-indulgence and a patently unremarkable third act.,Bill Watters
"A satisfying superhero drama, and a great reunion of the cast of two of Shyamalan's best films.",Felix Vasquez Jr.
"Glass is overcome with big ideas that overshadow some of the smaller, more intimate moments that Shyamalan has proved he can do exceptionally well.",Stephanie Watts
"Most filmmakers today don't take risks of this scale with original stories. Shyamalan didn't take the safe route, and in so doing, will polarize audiences.",Chris Stuckmann
"There are a lot of stories and characters just jammed into one movie...Samuel L. Jackson did play his part so well, though, and I enjoyed every scene he was in.",Steph Cozza
"Hard to know how to describe it, but the phrase grandiose nonsense springs to mind.",Paul Whitington
"To see McAvoy fully realize each persona with such fluidity, sometimes with nothing more than an expression and a brief sentence, is a thing of wonder to behold. The film in which he shows off this feat of thespian derring-do is anything but.",Andrea Chase
"Glass is now the second-least-impressive title, after The Last Airbender, in Shyamalan's canon. Sigh.",Rashid Irani
"January 18, 2019",Melissa Leon
"In lieu of elaborate set pieces and special effects, there's brooding drama on the nature of power delivered at a deliberate pace.",Annlee Ellingson
"You have to admire Shyamalan's efforts to deconstruct a genre that he evidently loves, yet there is just so little to haunt or to fool us in the result, and a few sharp laughs might have helped his cause.",Anthony Lane
"Shyamalan does what he can to put together two tonally different tales, but the results don't always mesh neatly.",Chris Knight
Glass is silly and dull when it should be thoughtful and tense.,Mike McGranaghan
Shyamalan - back on the downward swoop of his career sine-wave - inadvertently demonstrates that the Unbreakable punchline cannot sustain even casual analysis.,Donald Clarke
"To cut to the chase, Glass is terrific but has its share of underwhelming moments. However, if you are the type who likes the journey regardless of the destination, Glass is your film.",Renuka Vyavahare
Totally fumbles the fanboy excitement it generated when Willis's David Dunn turned and looked at the camera at the end of Split.,Frank Wilkins
"Why was Shyamalan, who has directed at least four objective failures over the course of his career, allowed yet another chance to prove what a disappointment he can be?",Barry Hertz
"Split decision on this one. It's not an unbreakable split decision, however. Loved James McAvoy's work but not much else.",Gary Wolcott
"With a great first two movies comes great responsibility. I was really expecting more from ""Glass,"" and I didn't get it. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)",Teddy Durgin
"Though it's intended as a follow-up to UNBREAKABLE, this one has earned the title 'Unbearable' - deserving of the coveted, rarely awarded distinction of Zero Stars.",Michael Medved
"M. Night Shyamalan's forced ""trilogy"" doesn't prove unbreakable and ends not a moment too soon with a weak third entry called 'Glass' , but despite a game cast you can see right through it.",Pete Hammond
"Glass is sort of like a vase that's been broken then glued back together - it still holds water, but you can see the cracks.",Staci Layne Wilson
"It's weird, it's daring and it's different, which is why it works.",Shingai Darangwa
"GLASS' third act descends into third-rate, fourth-wall allegorical self parody, in which unbelievers (critics) and adversaries (competitors or, as he sees them, imitators) are shot down.",Rubin Safaya
"Although the execution isn't as clean as it could (and probably should be), Shyamalan's three-quel isn't like any other superhero movie you're likely to see this year.",Brandy McDonnell
"There are some awesome moments and it's certainly not The Happening levels of bad, but, overall, Glass is a massive disappointment.",Matt Hudson
"I've always been a Glass half-full fan of Shyamalan, but this drab disappointment has shattered my faith.",James Croot
"The concept is intriguing but the emotional payoff is negligible, the surprise ending is feeble and the whole enterprise resembles a recycling bin.",Joe Morgenstern
"January 18, 2019",Vincent Mancini
The faux-intellectual clutter contaminates the whole experience. It's where you feel Shymalan's gnawing presence. His need to feel smart. His utter conceit in every overly written scene. It would all be forgivable if it weren't so condescending...,Katherine Monk
"With its many characters alternately showcased and neglected, Glass is a strange movie. In its haunted, haunting way, it's also a satisfying one.",Jesse Hassenger
"While Glass doesn't shatter the rankings against Split, it certainly holds a mirror to it in terms of storytelling and performances.",Amanda Sink
"The most exciting part of this type of trilogy is getting everyone into the same room, so Shyamalan doesn't waste a lot of time getting to at least one of the more anticipated meetings.",Sarah Gopaul
"When Glass is a Samuel L Jackson prison-break movie, it's a lot of fun.",Jamie Dunn
"This is Shyamalan at his worst, a speechifying, moralizing scold who wants your adoration but doesn't want to put in the effort, or himself at risk, to earn it.",Will Leitch
"While its characters might be extraordinary, Glass remains nothing out of the ordinary.",Matt Rodriguez
I'm fine with slow and talky. What sucks is how this talent is completely wasted on this material.,Bobby Roberts
"A fun, escapism film that doesn't always hit the right notes, but it does accomplish the goal of connecting ""Split"" with ""Unbreakable"" and setting up another sequel.",Pamela Powell
"A long-winded, thinly-premised, half-baked mess of a movie. It appears Shyamalan has both given up and run out of steam.",Louisa Moore
"Shattered. Broken. Cracked. Insert whichever pun you choose. Personally, this is one piece of glass I won't want to be looking at ever again.",Michael Ward
"The flaw in Glass's surface is, ironically, its opacity. Instead of interrogating the structure of superhero narratives, Shyamalan uses it as a crutch, explicitly drawing attention to it whenever his story begins to topple.",Christopher Machell
"For those intrigued but not anticipating too much, it's the sort of flawed but reasonably entertaining effort that can be viewed as ""Glass,"" half full.",Brian Lowry
"If this is indeed the beginning of a Shyamalan Cinematic Universe, God help us all.",Piers Marchant
"We waited 19 years for this? Dumb plot, dumber dialogue.",James Verniere
As it is formed - and in spite of its weaknesses - it's a great trilogy that satisfies simply by being different and original. [Full review in Spanish],Emmanuel Báez
"Shyamalan - who was so keen on exposing film conventions in his prime - ironically turns ""Glass"" into a mockery of his past works. This film should've shattered expectations, and it ends up feeling broken.",Nate Adams
"Beware the ides of March, and the films of January, especially if said film comes with the label ""from M. Night Shyamalan.""",Rain Jokinen
"Sadly, Glass isn't quite tight enough to drive home its points. In that looseness we find a sin worse than sloppiness or authorial vanity: we find boredom.",Sonny Bunch
"January 18, 2019",David Nusair
"One of the most unique superhero movies to hit the big screen, and Shyamalan deserves credit for taking a new angle on a well-trod subject.",Josh Terry
"So while what happens is cool, it comes at the cost of being a better standalone than sequel. [It's] more about the twist than the journey, something his best work [avoids].",Jared Mobarak
The endless delusion-based talk from an irritating shrink (Sarah Paulson) starts taking much of the starch out of a yarn that had begun rather intriguingly.,John Urbancich
"Momentum can be as fragile as glass, and the cracks are all too apparent in this trilogy.",Phil Villarreal
It is a successful movie on its own terms and an ideal closing chapter to M. Night Shyamalan's Eastrail 177 trilogy.,Matthew Rozsa
"A movie so smart, slow, derivative, playful and self-aware that there is no choice but to surrender. [Full Review in Spanish]",Luis Martínez
"Shyamalan swings for the fences with his trilogy capper, but for all it's ambition, it ultimately disappoints. [Full Review in Spanish]",Mario Alegre
"""Glass,"" it turns out, is broken.",Adam Graham
'It's better than The Last Airbender!' is not the praise you wanted to hear about the hotly anticipated Glass.,Christian Toto
"I liked it but...Glass needed an editor. Someone to dial it back, give it focus, and help to find the truelife moments that make good comics and good comic book movies work.",Sherin Nicole
"What's frustrating, beyond Shyamalan's inordinate fascination with his own work and his precious final-act twists, is that there really is nobody to root for in Glass.",Johnny Gayzmonic
"The real plot twist in Glass comes not at the end of the movie but about halfway through, when you realize it won't be getting any better.",Kurt Loder
"Suffice to say, this is not the Unbreakable sequel that that film's first fans had hoped for. The sickly mania of Split's shenanigans is more like it and then some, discarding Unbreakable's slick brooding for something tacky and dull.",Chris Feil
"It is a frequently clever elaboration of the ""Unbreakable"" morality tale and, to me, that feels like enough.",Chris Hewitt
"Bruce Willis, once the biggest movie star on the planet, has been made to surrender top-billing, and Shyamalan, once the path-breaking genius, is now offering meta-commentary on not only comic books and comic book culture, but also, strangely, his career.",Rohan Naahar
An unconventional superhero story that gets too convoluted and lacks all the thrills of its predecessor. [Full Review in Spanish],Rene Sanchez
I hope Shyamalan drops his grand ambitions to explain the Unified Theory of Everything and gets back to freaking us all out.,Robert Horton
"(The film becomes) too self-aware and grasping for some sense of self-importance, something that Unbreakable and Split (to a lesser degree) earned on their own.",Colby Bryant
Maybe over time we'll appreciate what Shyamalan attempted with Glass upon further reflection.,Jeffrey Lyles
"January 17, 2019",Matthew Dougherty
James McAvoy returns with more personalites against a Bruce Willis that has accepted his nature as a hero. [Full Review in Spanish],Sergio López Aguirre
"Unlike its predecessors, the film is forced to apply a rigorous narrative logic and expose their surprises with obvious and perhaps predictable calculation. [Full Review in Spanish]",Jordi Costa
"Aptly enough, the deficiencies of Glass are entirely transparent: a terrific cast, let down by a director whose primary motivation seems to be to entertain himself, not his audience.",Brian Viner
"Is the Glass half-empty or half-full? Just let it break, suspend disbelief and let the M. Night rise with three actors who always entertain.",Thelma Adams
Shyamalan reduced Glass to a carnival prisoner of a lack of attention to its characters. [Full Review in Spanish],Paula Vázquez Prieto
"As with Shyamalan's other films, characters don't act like human beings but are simply plot devices.",Daniel M. Kimmel
"Depending on how ready you are to embrace (or forgive) M. Night Shyamalan's nerdy, talky, intertwined comic book mythos, this trilogy closer is surprisingly enjoyable on many levels.",Jeffrey M. Anderson
"Makes about as much sense as the whispering trees in ""The Happening.""",Tom Meek
This is what happens when a stunt becomes canon.,Norman Wilner
Nineteen years is a long time to wait for a sequel that's so unsatisfying.,Wenlei Ma
"Glass is his most ambitious project to date, an attempt to create an original Shyamalan Cinematic Universe, and it's a big failure.",Deirdre Crimmins
"Mostly, though, it's an underwhelming, half-baked, slightly sour and even off-putting finale.",Richard Roeper
"This is not the first time that Shyamalan has been defeated by his outsized belief of his own cleverness, nor assuredly will it be the last.",Steve Katz
"The movie stumbles making it to that finish line, and it digresses from its straightforward tale...",André Hereford
"The filmmaker's latest ... sets out to further subvert our superhero expectations, but it just ends up undermining the great conceit of the first film...",Mark Dujsik
"Through its many ups and downs, Glass still stands as a somewhat decent sequel to two of Shyamalan's best entries.",Andrew J. Salazar
"The timeline is barely comprehensible, with twists so openly telegraphed they'd have saved the Titanic.",Joshua Rivera
I was riveted with the breadth and depth of Shyamalan's continued dissection of comic book mythology and culture.,Sara Michelle Fetters
Shyamalan's meta-conversation with a nowadays superhero-saturated audience feels overbearing and rote.,Marc Savlov
"January 17, 2019",Kyle Smith
"The bigger his thematic ambition, the more Shyamalan seems to lose control. If Sarah Paulson's Dr. Staple is looking for a character with delusions of grandeur in this film, she might not have to look further than the director himself.",Eric Melin
"It's a medium ado about not much at all, masquerading as a big deal; pull off that mask, as we finally do, and it's just Shyamalan, hardly worth the effort.",Christopher Llewellyn Reed
"Caught between the high stakes of a superhero film, and the narrative intricacy that is Shyamalan's specialty, the film fails at both.",Elena Lazic
A lot of windbag monologues... Paulson's character gets the most of this wretched dialogue -- a character so two-dimensional that the performance is doomed from the start.,Micheal Compton
"Shyamalan has come up with a solid, if somewhat underwhelming, idea here only to undercut it time and time again with lazy screenwriting. The sole reason to see ""Glass"" is to once again marvel at McAvoy's tremendously entertaining acting gymnastics.",Laura Clifford
"What we have here, essentially, is not the final grand statement to an overarching narrative but merely a Glass that's half empty, half full (of itself).",David Fear
"Try as he might, the pieces don't coalesce and like countless Shyamalan features, compelling ideas are besmirched by cloying passages of dialogue and a screenplay which deserves to be as smart as its story promises.",Nicholas Bell
"Shyamalan's precise vision is delicately crafted within the frameworks of a comic book, yet it defies and delivers a complex psychological study of the human condition.",Ben Rolph
"Shyamalan is so intent on not making a conventional superhero movie, he ends up not making much of a movie at all. This Glass isn't half-empty; it's not even one-third full.",Peter Howell
"Its plot is absurdly contrived, and very stilted, even by Shyamalan's own standards.",Geoffrey Macnab
The kind of depressing misfire that hurts even more given what it could have been.,Brian Tallerico
An inconsistent but highly entertaining ending to M. Night Shyamalan's UNBREAKABLE/SPLIT trilogy.,Chris Bumbray
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but you should watch ""Bird Box"" instead.",Brad Keefe
The sequel to 'Unbreakable' and 'Split' adds another layer to the glass onion of self-conscious genre riffing.,Kerry Lengel
Glass is a polarizing film that combines the strengths and the weaknesses of its two predecessors in a not-altogether-successful hybrid. And yet...there's something fascinating and complex about it nonetheless.,Joe Lipsett
"A masterful storyteller and for two decades a Hollywood hitmaker, M. Night Shyamalan's ""Glass"" (opening Friday) is an audacious, ambitious effort to build on his past successes.",Stephen Schaefer
"""Glass"" ... begins to crack after the first 20-plus minutes and shatters before the 129-minute fade-out, leaving behind shards of unfulfilled plot points, a convoluted story and a messy, lazy script ...",Bob Bloom
"Shyamalan's talent for primitive scares remains intact in ""Glass,"" as does his love for cramming a whole lot of story in one feature.",Manohla Dargis
Shyamalan brings together in Glass the narrative lines of Unbreakable and Split in a satisfying and coherent way. [Full review in Spanish],Ruben Peralta Rigaud
"January 17, 2019",A.A. Dowd
"Its third act is so hopelessly inept, I'd have preferred the writer/director just default to a ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" ending, unceremoniously wrapping the film mid-scene...",Sara Stewart
"Unfortunately, the cast's goodwill is all in service of a cranky magician who would rather show off his skill, instead of wow his audience.",Alan Zilberman
"Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan makes a valiant, if also, terribly forced and muddled effort to pull together two of his previous films and three character mythologies that span some 19 years.",Jonathan W. Hickman
"Shyamalan has lots to say about superheroes and has waited a long time to say it... an unfocused film with so much expositional dialogue in place of action, it's sometimes more of a lecture than a thriller.",Jim Slotek
"Shyamalan's shot compositions are impressive to behold throughout, making ""Glass"" often appear like a living, breathing artwork and inducing grins in this reviewer throughout over his audacious shot and color choices.",Carl Kozlowski
"Overlong, and with no satisfying payoff, 'Glass' is broken.",Roger Tennis
"Glass isn't a superhero film as much as it's a sequel to the understated world of Unbreakable and a loving ode to the world of comic books. Approach it knowing that, and you'll most likely enjoy it.",Iain McNally
"Glass is more interested in constant conversation and questioning, exploiting and milking Shyamalan's fascination with the stories we tell, how we tell them, and who gets to tell them, for all its worth",Juan Barquin
"Glass is very mixed bag: compelling when it's good, but numbing and absurd when it's bad.",Andrew Wyatt
"Glass betrays the elegant narrative of Unbreakable and James McAvoy's command performance from Split. Pedantic, dreary, dunderheaded, as bloodless as its ideas and lethally verbose. It is the worst possible sequel outcome.",Nick Rogers
"May be the fulfillment of Shyamalan's long-gestating dream, but it's a dreary downer for the audience-a portentous, self-indulgent dirge that limps its way to a feeble conclusion.",Frank Swietek
... Looks and feels nothing like the superhero movies that have taken over Hollywood in the past decade.,Greg Maki
Is it good? No. Is it watchable? Infinitely.,Hannah Woodhead
"Shyamalan's geeky intersection of comic book culture, superhero backstories and pop mythology builds to a showdown, but it's more of a letdown.",Neil Pond
I'm glad I had the chance to jump back into the comic-book-fueled world of Mr. Glass and James McAvoy proves to be the film's MVP but Shyamalan takes too long to get to the film's climax that is ultimately a letdown.,Joe Friar
A clever but plodding exploration of group psychosis.,Chris Hunneysett
"If there's a superhero to prevent unnecessary sequels, now would be a good time to step in.",Maren Longbella
"""Glass"" ranks as one of the more laborious trilogy cappers in recent years, forcibly entwining two narratives that don't really feel like natural fits with each other.",Michael Phillips
Shyamalan believes so strongly in the dramatic impact of this trilogy that he almost makes you believe in it too-that's his secret superpower. But the illusion is fragile.,Stephanie Zacharek
"January 17, 2019",Glen Weldon
"Glass starts strongly and fizzles, a dramatic droop which is initially camouflaged by the escalating grandiosity of visual rhetoric, something febrile and high-concept that is visionary in everything except actually having vision.",Peter Bradshaw
Glass is more interested in having the characters from its two predecessor films meet and confront each other than in actually having anything happen when they do.,Matt Looker
The monotony replacing ambition pushes viewers to be ready for washed-out despondency.,Don Shanahan
"It's an awkward conclusion to a trilogy that started out with great promise, which in a way makes it perfect for the Shyamalan brand.",Josh Bell
An uneven but satisfying finale to an accidental trilogy that looks like an action/thriller but is really an exploration of modern superhero mythology.,Christopher Lloyd
"All that foreshadowing sets up expectations for a massive climax - one that, because of the story reminding the viewer of how epic it is, sabotages itself and becomes distinctly underwhelming.",John Lui
This movie is a genuine disaster -- a grotesque mishmash of two distinct narratives that clearly do not go together into some kind of grand cinematic peanut butter cup.,Peter Sobczynski
"It's the work of a filmmaker who, no less than the genre he's trying to reimagine, feels stuck on repeat.",Justin Chang
"I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. Yet for a Shyamalan film, I'd rather take disappointment over disastrous any day.",Rendy Jones
"Sucking up to comic-book devotees while also mocking them viciously, it's almost offensive on several levels but, in the end, simply proves too damn silly to take that seriously.",David 'Mad Dog' Bradley
The problem is Shyamalan has not kept up with the times.,Ani Bundel
"""Glass"" is a movie so muddled and so meta that it not only seeks to remind you - implicitly, and every five minutes - how movies work, but it includes a character who explicitly comments upon the action.",Michael O'Sullivan
"""Glass"" isn't a terrible film but neither is it a particularly good one, and it certainly doesn't stick the landing the way the filmmaker and his hardy fans have probably hoped.",Ty Burr
"While it's true that the [superhero] genre is already a little tired, this is not the way to renew it. [Full review in Spanish]",Gaspar Zimerman
"I'm not sure if the title is referring to the brittle bone-diseased but intelligent master orchestrator of dastardly plans Mr. Glass or how fragile the plot becomes as soon as one begins to analyze it, even at surface value",Robert Kojder
Glass glints just enough for a drink.,Cameron Meier
"Unsure if it wants to be grounded in reality or embrace its fantastical premise, Glass is unable to strongly deliver on either.",Jonathan Barkan
"Fittingly, Glass feels like three personalities at war with one another.",Scott Wampler
"Talky, low-energy endeavor that slowly stitches together the worlds of the previous chapters, with Shyamalan unwilling to do anything more with this universe than portion it out in small bites.",Brian Orndorf
"January 16, 2019",Jordan Ruimy
"[Glass] will be best appreciated by audiences who value playfulness and imagination over restrictive notions of logic, plausibility and good taste.",Jake Wilson
"If Glass was always the endpoint in the director's wished-for trilogy, then it's very clear from the final product that Shyamalan didn't update or revise that concept.",Kyle Anderson
"M Night Shyamalan's trilogy isn't a shattering disappointment, Glass is so out to dazzle you with its convoluted universe-folding that it becomes a turn-off.",Larushka Ivan-Zadeh
"M. Night Shyamalan has crafted a very effective creepshow with ""Glass,"" a shotgun marriage of his 2000 horror hit ""Unbreakable"" and 2016's ""Split,"" an even bigger blockbuster.",Soren Andersen
The 'Glass' is half empty in laughably bad ending to Shyamalan trilogy.,Matt Oakes
"Rather than being a more grounded and stylized homeopathic antidote to Marvel films, Shyamalan has delivered a strange journey into the meaning and the hope to be found in comic books.",Brian Roan
"When your third act falls apart, that's what people are going to remember, and I feel that's what happened here.",Jeremy Jahns
"...while it certainly has cracks, Glass does not completely shatter under its own thematic weight.",Travis Hopson
Worst movie of 2019!,Mick LaSalle
"People in some glass houses should throw stones. I'm all for tomatoes, too, in the case of Glass, the new thriller from M. Night Shyamalan.",Nigel Andrews
"Glass is like a comic with an incredible cover that promises an amazing story, but inside the art and story are lackluster. But anyone who enjoyed Unbreakable or Split should go to Glass to see how it all ends up.",Michael Sangiacomo
Glass is the most Shyamalan film the director has ever made: only in the sense that you wonder - what could have been.,Robert Daniels
"Two hours and nine minutes roll by, and the film is about as frustrating as standing in a TSA line at the airport.",Dwight Brown
"The relative success of Split seems to have given Shyamalan license to create another indulgent, sloppy tantrum of a film.",Sean Collier
"Glass disappoints, but is not unwatchable. It's not in the same league of Unbreakable and Split. James McAvoy continues to be sensational as The Horde.",Julian Roman
"Suffice to say whatever illusions of a comeback M. Night Shyamalan may have had are likely shattered, like so many of Elijah Price's brittle bones.",Clint Worthington
"A mix of half-formed ideas baked into an uneven casserole. Overlong, talky, filled with meta references, and with a strangely low-energy tone, the movie never fully gels.",James Berardinelli
"Glass concludes Shyamalan's superhero movie trilogy in a manner that manages to be absorbing, frustrating, and bewildering at the same time.",Sandy Schaefer
"The plot to 'Glass' is as broken and splintery as Elijah's bones, but the 19-year-old payoff for 'Unbreakable' fans may be worth your time.",Jamie Broadnax
"January 16, 2019",Kevin Harley
"It's all so antiquated, grooving by with the swagger of Billy Madison sidling up to Generation Xers in an REO Speedwagon shirt. Glass is not just late on arrival, but dead on arrival, and the collateral damage is two solid films and one comeback.",Michael Roffman
"Glass lives up to the hype and was worth the 19-year wait. Is it flawless? Absolutely not, but I don't believe Shyamalan has ever made a film that was.",Scott Menzel
"As mixed quality as this movie is, I still respect that it tries to do something different with comic book mythology, and even with its flaws it is still worth watching--just to see M. Night finish his 19-year-long journey with these characters.",Michelle Kisner
A watchable but self-serious and pointless dissection of the comic book genre.,Roger Moore
"The main thing to savour is what a downright weird dude the director is, and how it bleeds into the movie. Glass is really strange.",Tony Stamp
"For diehard fans hoping for a signature twist (or two), the payoff is pretty sweet.",Jeanmarie Tan
"One of the most impressive aspects of the script is the way it gives entire character arcs to several of the personalities that dwell inside Kevin Crumb's head, and McAvoy plays them out fully across his face and body.",Vinnie Mancuso
"For all the hype behind these three characters meeting, and the years it took to get it off the ground, ""Glass"" is one big anti-climax.",Lindsey Bahr
"Shyamalan tosses the audience morsels of McAvoy during the dour treatise on comic book morality and existential questions about superheroes that is ""Glass.""",Katie Walsh
"As someone who felt that Unbreakable was somewhat lacking, Shyamalan shows his growth as a filmmaker by making a far more enjoyable, mainstream film that tries to satisfy both old and new fans.",Edward Douglas
"Its relentlessly jarring tone makes it gripping, partly because Shyamalan, as usual, withholds key information.",Rich Cline
I see disappointed people.,Mara Reinstein
"[Shyamalan] falls into unlikely situations and also generates expectations that he does not fulfill, but always in order to demonstrate his mastery in a film about manipulators where he is the king. [Full Review in Spanish]",Emiliano Basile
"Never a particularly subtle director, Shyamalan gives you all the clues you need to figure out most of his third-act twists, provided you know what you're looking for.",Emma Stefansky
"GLASS' lackluster vibe hints at a director who has become uninspired. It's shocking, but shouldn't be so surprising that the buildup for GLASS ended up being a shattering disappointment.",James Clay
Shyamalan only half-heartedly attempts to build a cinematic universe. Partly making it a twist and partly building a world makes for a wholly unsatisfying experience.,Joey Magidson
I would love a Marvel movie to film their battles the way Shyamalan does. He can show extraordinary feats while obscuring some aspect of it to activate the viewer's own imagination.,Fred Topel
"Bringing [the trio of intriguing characters] back was a good idea, but this reunion isn't quite the story they deserve.",James Mottram
The sequel to Unbreakable and Split ratifies and underlines the limits and the excess of Shyamalan. [Full Review in Spanish],Diego Batlle
"January 14, 2019",Simon Miraudo
"It's a letdown, despite a good amount of emotional richness and occasional glimpses of greatness.",Brian Truitt
"Oh, these poor actors.",David Edelstein
"Likely to be a big disappointment for many fans of the two other films, Glass falls flat and leaves so much more to be desired.",Ashley Menzel
"Shyamalan not only raises his voice to talk about comics and supermen when referring to Glass, but transcends the genre without being infected by Marvel / DC fever. [Full review in Spanish]",Janire Zurbano
"Misplaced attempts at humour fall flat. Bizarre characters make bizarre decisions and yet we're asked to believe this is a superhero tale firmly grounded in reality. Willis and Jackson look bored, while McAvoy pushes the very limits of hamminess.",Hilary A White
As we so often say with Shyamalan: Maybe next time...,Witney Seibold
"With an ambitious and admirable scope, 'Glass' is a film that shoots for the moon but gets lost with too many detours on its journey, leaving us with a jumbled mess of a film.",Doug Jamieson
"Glass feels the most like Unbreakable. It's such a well-made thing, and Shyamalan didn't disappoint me.",Mark Ellis
"A very well-done movie, it comes down to whether or not you like the ending...a good movie, with a bit disappointing payoff.",Kristian Harloff
"It is safe to say that M. Night has safely redeemed himself after a rather spotty period in the 00's. Glass is not a perfect movie, but it is a consistently entertaining one.",Norm Gidney
A film every bit as stupefying and meandering as Shyamalan's worst efforts.,Tyler Smith
"All this pseudish cultural analysis robs the story of its emotion. It's not the lack of action, it's the lack of feeling that's the problem.",Ed Potton
"It's great that Glass strives for deeper meaning. However, by throwing so much at the audience so quickly, it unravels its own goal.",Brandon Katz
"Never sure whether it's a heroic superhero story or a psychological thriller, Glass feels more than a little scattered and with its uneven and disappointing third act, ultimately unsatisfying.",Rosie Knight
The latest from the director is a singularly strange and meta sequel that's bound to infuriate all but his most devoted fans.,David Sims
"Tying various loose threads together, Shyamalan can't restrain himself from adding more. The result's a lumpy tangle, and the trilogy's weakest instalment.",Tim Robey
The conclusion of this film is a worse disaster than Eastrail 177.,Eric Eisenberg
"...well made, well acted, gorgeously shot film that is worth a look, but for audience members invested in these stories, in these characters, it may prove a somewhat sluggish and deflating experience.",Anthony O'Connor
M. Night Shyamalan gives in to his worst instincts again - to shatter an otherwise promising movie with thousands of jagged pieces made up of overarching theories and obvious plot-twist setups. Great acting and some funny moments can't save it.,J. Don Birnam
"January 9, 2019",Joshua Rothkopf
"Maybe 'The Visit' was a fluke, and the M. Night Shyamalan who made 'Sixth Sense,' 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs' is really gone for good...",Scott Mendelson
"As much as I enjoyed ""Glass,"" I don't think it's better than ""Unbreakable"" or ""Split.""",Kirsten Acuna
"Essentially a Split sequel with an Unbreakable topping, this is weaker than either of those films but still has a decent amount of entertaining and creepy sequences, most of them due to McAvoy's high-commitment performance.",Nick De Semlyen
"Glass offers answers and brings the trilogy neatly to a largely successful close, without completely wrapping things up in a neat bow.",Ian Sandwell
"Put into comic-book terms, Glass takes too long to get from one panel to the next.",Chris Nashawaty
There are so many ideas at play here (perhaps too many) that one cannot help but wonder if Shyamalan is playing an elevated game of bait and switch.,Don Kaye
"Not only does Shyamalan seem to have forgotten what made its two predecessors work so well, but he fails to realize that it's his lack of imagination, not audiences', that keeps them from believing in superheroes.",Todd Gilchrist
"Watching Glass is like going to the movies with that one friend who cannot help leaning over to whisper one banal observation after another into your ear, and then leaning back satisfied that he's just blown your mind.",Angie Han
Glass is the absolute natural progression to the trilogy that M. Night Shyamalan set up with Unbreakable and with Split.,Dan Murrell
"This is clearly one 'for the fans', but those fans might have had their hearts set on a more rousing conclusion.",Matt Maytum
"Despite the pyrotechnics of McAvoy's performances and Willis's grounded conviction, there's just not enough here past the high concept of ""what if real people were superheroes?""...",Fionnuala Halligan
"Honestly, I'm looking forward to what Shyamalan does next. I've enjoyed his career resurgence. But Glass is a big disappointment.",Mike Ryan
"I left Glass feeling less annoyed by Shyamalan doing his thing than I may have in the past. It's actually a little fun to have him around again, demanding our awe.",Richard Lawson
"For all of the endless blather about how comic books have the power to reveal all of our secret identities - one of Jackson's pronouncements about the power of narrative tropes veers close to making ""Glass"" feel like the ""Life Itself"" of superhero movies.",David Ehrlich
"There's a sense of drama and urgency throughout which helps, but one does get the sense Shyamalan thinks he's painting his masterpiece.",Rodrigo Perez
"On a purely practical level, Glass is drawn-out and disjointed, with disparate plot threads (some of them leading to, yes, a perfunctory rug pull) that seem dictated more by its stars' availability than narrative cohesion.",Sam Adams
It's so heavily indebted to its predecessors that much of the emotional impact will be lost on anyone who hasn't watched the other films.,Monica Castillo
"Though satisfying enough to work at the multiplex, it doesn't erase memories of the ways that even movies before the abjectly awful After Earth and The Last Airbender made us wary of the words ""a film by M. Night Shyamalan.""",John DeFore
"Like Superman exposed to kryptonite, directing Glass has robbed Shyamalan of his powers.",Chris Evangelista
"January 9, 2019",Owen Gleiberman
"Given the visual and intellectual sophistication in the superhero movies Hollywood now churns out at a regular clip, Glass just doesn't cut it.",Matt Singer
"It feels like a movie from a filmmaker who has some amazing puzzle pieces-and yet, even after almost 20 years, no clear vision of how to put them together",Germain Lussier
I want to believe in superheroes. It's just that Glass never quite manages to take flight.,Karen Han
"Glass feels like fan service that tries too hard to replicate earlier success, and manages to diminish both Unbreakable and Split in retrospect.",Alissa Wilkinson
"This fresh tomato is largely for James McAvoy's electric performance. But this is M Night's worst ""twist ending"" yet, as the filmmaker throws away everything he's built here.",Grace Randolph
