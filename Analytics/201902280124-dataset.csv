Deborah Ross,"The first two movies had heart, charm, wit, originality, parfait and, most unusually for an animation, characters you could properly care about. This, though, has very little of any of the above, and it breaks my heart.","August 22, 2018"
Brandy McDonnell,"August 14, 2018",
Tony Delgado,"With a plot lacking no urgency, Shrek 3 is a well-animated film containing a few standout, but ultimately throwaway sequences that don't do enough to sustain our interest.","July 6, 2010"
Fernando F. Croce,Computer-animated ugliness,"August 27, 2009"
Peter Keough,"From its humble, elegant origins as a slim children's book by William Steig, Shrek has metastasized into a symptom of and metaphor for the entertainment industry and modern culture in general.","April 23, 2009"
Tony Macklin,"Shrek the Third has the curse of the third in a bankable series. It is too often sappy, tiresome, and overblown. A franchise such as Shrek, with all the money it has accumulated, should be able to buy a little freshness and originality. But instead","February 2, 2009"
Bob Mondello,"Apart from some modestly amusing princess shtick and a pleasantly slapsticky opening, there's no real reason for anyone over the age of 11 to see this one.","October 18, 2008"
John J. Puccio,"The best thing it has going for it is its look, which is stunning.","September 20, 2008"
Rossiter Drake,"Though the devious wit of the original remains, it is obscured by too many classic-rock interludes (courtesy of Led Zeppelin, Heart and Paul McCartney) and nudging pop-culture references that seem by now just part of the formula.","April 10, 2008"
David Ansen,"This is a very skillfully made corporate product, but I wonder who, exactly, will be fully satisfied.","April 7, 2008"
Jeff Bayer,"The problem with this film is that after a quick, fun beginning they repeat a similar journey from the first film. Except this time, Shrek and Artie argue instead of Shrek and Fiona.","March 3, 2008"

Tim Brayton,It's far too open in its desires (MAKING MONEY) to be hate-worthy.,"September 14, 2007"

Daily Mirror (UK),Under-10s will probably enjoy it while adults will feel they've seen it all before. Which isn't quite the fairytale ending we'd all hoped for.,"June 29, 2007"
Neil Smith,"There's no doubt Shrek The Third will make potloads of money. Pity it shortchanges the audience with an underwhelming plot and characters you sense are just going through the motions. When it's good it's great. Overall, though, the magic is lacking.","June 29, 2007"
Sukhdev Sandhu,"In the end, Shrek the Third, like so many Hollywood animation movies today, neither trusts itself nor cares to create any new magic. If it were a child in a classroom, it would be the back-row smart arse, rather than the poetic dreamer.","June 29, 2007"

David Edelstein,"Computer-generated animated movies with wall-to-wall jokes can be excruciating, but these jokes are the funniest money can buy.","June 29, 2007"
Dan Jolin,"Another summer threequel, another case of slipping standards - not so much in the visuals, which remain predictably impressive, but in the all-important gag rate. To waste both Donkey and Puss is a crime...","June 29, 2007"
Matthew Turner,"Uninspired threequel, though the animation is better than ever and there's a steady stream of chuckles, even if it does lack the magic of the previous films.","June 28, 2007"

Enrique Buchichio,"June 25, 2007",

Cole Smithey,"This out-of-tune, off-kilter, lame-o finale (oh how I hope it's the last one) to the Mike Meyers-led ""Shrek"" franchise is so far removed from the first two films that doesn't seem related.","June 5, 2007"

Michael A. Smith,"The best ""Shrek"" of them all!","May 19, 2007"
Tasha Robinson,"Sequels usually follow the rubric 'same thing as last time, but more.' Shrek The Third instead goes for less: fewer jokes, less energy, and toned-down characters reiterating old banter, as if from a half-finished outline of a script.","May 19, 2007"

Claudia Puig,The world of the fanciful fable looks particularly vibrant this time with its signature blend of realism and fantasy. It is a pleasure to watch these fairy tale folk be themselves -- yet again.,"May 18, 2007"
Maitland McDonagh,"The real trouble is that the filmmakers consistently choose gags over character. Playing King Harold's death for comedy? He's Fiona's father, even if he is a frog -- Shrek would never have gone for a cheap laugh like that.","May 18, 2007"

David Elliott,"Essentially the movie is saying to its loyal crowd: You bought this stuff before, now take it re-canned. There is nothing really happening but the breezy ricochet of gags, the rote sitcom types, the star voices that are phoning in performances.","May 18, 2007"
Carla Meyer,"Shrek the Third offers few surprises but packages its predictable elements quite delightfully. The pacing is brisk and the jokes nearly constant, with enough silliness for kids and cleverness for parents.","May 18, 2007"

Peter Travers,"There's no disguising the fact that Shrek the Third has come down with a bad case of sequelitis. You know the symptoms: Lots of razzle-dazzle to distract from the hole at the center of the story. You know, the place where fresh ideas should be.","May 17, 2007"
Roger Moore,"It's fitfully amusing, and only 80 minutes long.","May 17, 2007"
Carrie Rickey,"As far as the adventures of Shrek go, it grieves me to report that the third time is charmless.","May 17, 2007"
Gene Seymour,"If you're into the last two installments, you'll find the same laughs here. Nothing more, nothing less.","May 17, 2007"
Bill Muller,At least this sequel finally establishes how many licks it takes to finish off a popular fairy tale spoof. Three.,"May 17, 2007"
Roger Ebert,"It makes the mistake of thinking slapstick action is funny for its own sake. True, characters zooming and bouncing around are easy to write because no creative invention is required to set them in motion. But so what?","May 17, 2007"
J. R. Jones,"The charm has evaporated. Cinephiles will enjoy some of the in-jokes (watching an awful play, one character cracks, ""This is worse than Love Letters""). But then, if you're a cinephile, why would you bother with this?","May 17, 2007"
Michael Phillips,I doubt even rabid fans of the first two will consider Shrek the Third a worthy addition to the franchise.,"May 17, 2007"
